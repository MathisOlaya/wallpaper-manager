## 🔐 Setup your own Pixabay API key (required for Search)

To use the search feature, you need a Pixabay API key:

1. Create or log in to your Pixabay account here: [pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com/)  
2. Visit the API documentation page: [pixabay.com/api/docs](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)  
3. Scroll down to the **Parameters** section and copy your *API KEY*

### Set your environment variable

Open a PowerShell window and run the following command (replace `"your-key-here"` with your actual key):

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PIXABAY_SECRET", "your-key-here", "User")
```

This will save the key to your user environment variables.

## 🪛 Configuration

Once your API key is set, Wallpaper Manager is ready to go! You can:

- Import local images and set them as your wallpaper  
- Search and save images from Pixabay directly  
- Customize various settings
